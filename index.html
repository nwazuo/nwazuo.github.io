              the client can see and have more confidence in his 'supposed'
              ability to deliver. Terrible idea, I know. But, I did it

              >This was from a virtual internship(HNG internship) in 2020. We
              were organized into several frontend teams and each team had to
              build out a design from the design team. Because we used Git and a
              lot of the team members weren't very good at CSS at the time, my
              team's project was a total mess. It looked like we weren't going
              to make it through that stage and I had some very good CSS
              skills(and still doðŸ™‚), so I spent the entire weekend, unknown to
              the team, rebuilding this from scratch. We eventually got through
              that stage but no one on the team knew that I took it upon myself
              to rebuild this.

              is a friend who is an amazing designer. Back in the early days, he
              posted a design he had made with Figma and I volunteered to
              implement it. I really liked the challenge of building a carousel
              from scratch because it sounded intimidating at the time.
